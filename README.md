I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Statistics & Data Science at **University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)**. My advisor is [Prof. Oscar Hernan Madrid Padilla](https://hernanmp.github.io). Previously, I interned at **Amazon Robotics**. I also received a B.S. in Statistics and a B.A. in Economics at UCLA. My research interests are 

- Generative Models
- Representation Learning
- Graph Inference
- Bayesian Methodology
- Anomaly Detection
- Computer Vision
