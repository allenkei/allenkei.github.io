I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Statistics and Data Sciense at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). My advisor is [Prof. Oscar Hernan Madrid Padilla](https://hernanmp.github.io). Previously, I received a B.S. in Statistics and a B.A. in Economics at UCLA in 2017. My research interests are 

- Generative Learning, Representation Learning, Unsupervised Learning
- Computer Vision
- Bayesian Inference and Empirical Bayes Methodology
- Generative, Temporal, and Latent Space Models for Complex Networks/Graphs
- Change Point Detection, Anomaly Detection
