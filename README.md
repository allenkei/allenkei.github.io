I am a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics at **University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC)**. I obtained a Ph.D. in Statistics at **University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)** in June 2024, under the supervision of [Prof. Oscar Hernan Madrid Padilla](https://hernanmp.github.io).

I am interested in gaining a better understanding of complex data to tackle real-world problems. Specifically, my research aims to develop realistic models and the associated inference and learning algorithms for multi-modal data, such as time series, graphs, and language, to allow useful *abstraction*, *generation*, and *detection*. 

My research has also been advised by [Prof. Mark S. Handcock](https://handcock.github.io) and [Prof. Ying Nian Wu](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~ywu/research.html) at UCLA, [Prof. Robert Lund](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6rejz8EAAAAJ), [Prof. Rebecca Killick](https://www.lancs.ac.uk/~killick/), [Prof. James D. Wilson](https://www.usfca.edu/faculty/james-wilson) during my current position at UCSC, and many other amazing collaborators.

My research interests are 

- Generative Models
- Representation Learning
- Graph Inference
- Anomaly Detection
- Empirical Bayes Methodology
- Optimization & Machine Learning

Previously, I received a B.S. in Statistics and a B.A. in Economics at UCLA. I also interned at **Amazon** and **Cisco**.
