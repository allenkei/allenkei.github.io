I am a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics at **University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC)**. I obtained a Ph.D. in Statistics at **University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)** in June 2024, under the supervision of [Prof. Oscar Hernan Madrid Padilla](https://hernanmp.github.io).


Previously, I interned at **Amazon**. I also received a B.S. in Statistics and a B.A. in Economics at UCLA. 


I am interested in a better understanding of complex data to tackle real-world problems. Specifically, my research aims to develop realistic models and the associated inference and learning algorithms for complex data such as time series, graphs, and language to allow useful abstraction, generation, and detection.


My research interests are 

- Generative Models
- Representation Learning
- Graph Inference
- Anomaly Detection
- Empirical Bayes Methodology
- Computer Vision & Natural Language Processing
