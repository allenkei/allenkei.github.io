[Actively searching for positions in Texas]

I am a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics at **University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC)**. I obtained a Ph.D. in Statistics at **University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)** in June 2024, under the supervision of [Prof. Oscar Hernan Madrid Padilla](https://hernanmp.github.io).

My research focuses on developing realistic models and the associated inference and learning algorithms for multi-modal data to allow useful **abstraction**, **generation**, and **detection**. Extracting meaningful representations from data (*abstraction*) can help devise powerful models that produce valid knowledge in a real-world setting (*generation*), while identifying anomalies when certain criteria are violated (*detection*).

My research has also been advised by [Prof. Mark S. Handcock](https://handcock.github.io) and [Prof. Ying Nian Wu](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~ywu/research.html) at UCLA, [Prof. Robert B. Lund](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6rejz8EAAAAJ), [Prof. Rebecca Killick](https://www.lancs.ac.uk/~killick/), [Prof. James D. Wilson](https://www.usfca.edu/faculty/james-wilson) during my current position at UCSC, and many other amazing collaborators.

My research interests are 

- Generative Models
- Representation Learning
- Graph Inference
- Anomaly Detection
- Empirical Bayes Methodology
- Optimization & Machine Learning

Previously, I have interned at **Amazon** and **Cisco**. I received a B.S. in Statistics and a B.A. in Economics at UCLA.
